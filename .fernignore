# TypeScript WebSocket fix (empty protocols array bug for Node.js v21+)
src/core/websocket/ws.ts

# Custom comprehensive README
README.md

# Environment switching fix (Gcp/Azure support)
# Fern generates incorrect environment structure, these are manually fixed:
# - environments.ts: Added wsUrl property for WebSocket URL resolution
# - apolloWsSession/Client.ts: Changed .gcp to .wsUrl for WebSocket URL resolution
src/environments.ts
src/api/resources/apolloWsSession/client/Client.ts

# Export fix for ApolloWsSessionSocket type
src/api/resources/apolloWsSession/client/index.ts

# Custom exports - add any additional type exports here
# This file is imported by index.ts via: export * from "./exports.js"
# SAFE: index.ts is NOT in fernignore, so new endpoints will still be added automatically
src/exports.ts
