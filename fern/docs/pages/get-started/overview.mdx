The AUI API enables you to build conversational AI agents powered by Apollo-1, the breakthrough neuro-symbolic foundation model for task-oriented dialogue. Unlike traditional generative AI models, Apollo-1 provides traceable decision-making, rule-based controllability, and reliable actions without sacrificing conversational fluency.

## What is AUI?

AUI (Augmented Intelligence) provides a complete platform for building AI agents that function on behalf of entities, not users. The platform combines REST APIs for task management with WebSocket connections for real-time bidirectional communication.

## Key Features

### Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning

Apollo-1 replaces the traditional transformer with a Neuro-Symbolic Reasoner as the model's decision-making core. This enables:

- **Procedural reasoning** - Step-by-step logical decision making
- **Steerable outputs** - Control over agent behavior and responses
- **Reliable actions** - Consistent and predictable agent actions
- **Conversational fluency** - Natural language understanding and generation

### Task Management

Create and manage conversational tasks with full lifecycle control:

- Create tasks with custom metadata
- Submit messages to tasks
- Retrieve task history and messages
- Pagination support for large message sets

### Real-time Communication

Connect via WebSocket for bidirectional streaming:

- Streaming text updates
- Product recommendations
- Follow-up suggestions
- Error handling with specific close codes

## Architecture

The AUI API consists of two main components:

1. **REST API** - HTTP endpoints for task and message management
2. **WebSocket API** - Real-time bidirectional communication channel

Both APIs work together seamlessly to provide a complete conversational AI platform.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication via the `x-network-api-key` header:

- **REST API**: `x-network-api-key` header
- **WebSocket API**: `x-network-api-key` header (automatically handled by SDK)

**Example:**
```
x-network-api-key: API_KEY_01K92N5BD5M7239VRK7YTK4Y6N
```

<Note>
Contact the AUI team to obtain your API key and get started. The official SDKs handle authentication automatically.

## Official SDKs

We provide official SDKs for TypeScript and Python with full type safety and automatic authentication:

**TypeScript/JavaScript**
```bash
npm install @aui.io/aui-client
```
- Version: 1.2.11
- Package: [@aui.io/aui-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aui.io/aui-client)
- GitHub: [aui-io/aui-client-typescript](https://github.com/aui-io/aui-client-typescript)

**Python**
```bash
pip install aui-client
```
- Version: 1.2.10
- Package: [aui-client](https://pypi.org/project/aui-client)
- GitHub: [aui-io/aui-client-python](https://github.com/aui-io/aui-client-python)

<Tip>
The SDKs handle authentication headers automatically - just pass your `networkApiKey` (TS) or `network_api_key` (Python) when initializing the client.
</Tip>

## Use Cases

The AUI API is ideal for:

- **Customer Support** - AI agents that can handle complex support queries
- **Task Automation** - Agents that complete multi-step workflows
- **Conversational Interfaces** - Natural language interfaces for applications
- **Enterprise AI** - Scalable AI solutions for Fortune 500 companies
